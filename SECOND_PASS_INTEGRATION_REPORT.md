## Data Limitations & Caveats

### 1. Self-Selection Bias
- Successful cases more likely to be published
- Vendor case studies may over-represent positive outcomes
- Failed projects underreported

### 2. Geographic Representation
- US/UK/EU overrepresented (76% of dataset)
- Emerging markets underrepresented (Asia 9%, Africa/LatAm 0%)
- Cultural/economic factors may not generalize

### 3. Temporal Considerations
- Dataset spans 2022-2026
- Economic conditions varied (post-COVID, inflation)
- AI technology rapidly evolving (2024-2025 GenAI boom)

### 4. Industry Coverage
- Some industries well-covered (manufacturing, retail, finance)
- Others sparse (agriculture 5%, construction 4%)
- Sector-specific models may need more data

### 5. Metric Estimation
- Some fields estimated when missing (revenue, investment)
- ROI calculations use various methods (67% calculated vs. 33% reported)
- Currency conversions use fixed rates (not transaction dates)

### 6. SME Definition Variability
- Employee counts vary by source
- Some "SME" cases may be larger than typical
- French PME/ETI classification may not match all contexts
