# Design Direction – Editorial Research Interface

## Design Intent
The UI should feel like an authored research artifact rather than a SaaS dashboard.
It should convey academic credibility, intentionality, and calm confidence.

The interface should support thinking, exploration, and explanation.

## Visual Tone
- Editorial and minimal
- Muted, warm, neutral color palette
- High contrast typography with generous whitespace
- Asymmetric layouts preferred over centered symmetry

## Layout Principles
- Left-aligned, narrative layouts
- One dominant focal point per page
- Reduce visible cards and borders
- Use spacing and typography instead of containers

## Typography
- Strong hierarchy (large headline, restrained body text)
- Headlines feel declarative and research-oriented
- Avoid playful or decorative fonts

## Interaction Philosophy
- Minimal motion
- No decorative animations
- UI should feel stable and serious when projected

## Page-Level Guidance

### Landing Page
- Large left-aligned title
- Subtle metadata (e.g., Presented at SEDSI)
- Abstract-style description
- Quiet visual or shape on the right (optional)

### Tool Page
- Inputs presented as a single narrative flow
- Results displayed as a typographic moment
- Emphasis on interpretation, not widgets

### Insights Page
- Text-led explanations
- Simple, restrained charts
- Figure-like presentation similar to academic papers

## Non-Goals
- SaaS-style dashboards
- Overuse of cards or widgets
- Heavy animations or visual effects
- Trend-driven UI patterns
